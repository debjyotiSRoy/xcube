## E**X**plainable E**X**treme Multi-Label Te**X**t Classification:

- *What is XMTC?* Extreme Multi-Label Text Classification (XMTC)
  addresses the problem of automatically assigning each data point with
  most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set. One
  major application of XMTC is in the global healthcare system,
  specifically in the context of the International Classification of
  Diseases (ICD). ICD coding is the process of assigning codes
  representing diagnoses and procedures performed during a patient visit
  using clinical notes documented by health professionals.

- *Datasets?* Examples of ICD coding dataset:
  [MIMIC-III](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) and
  [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-note/2.2/). Please
  note that you need to be a credentialated user and complete a training
  to acces the data.

- *What is xcube?* xcube trains and explains XMTC models using LLM
  fine-tuning.

## Install

- Create new conda environment:

``` sh
conda create -n xxx python=3.10
```

``` sh
conda activate xxx
```

- Install PyTorch with cuda enabled: \[Optional\]

``` sh
conda search pytorch
```

<img alt="output of conda search pytorch" width="400" src="pics/pytorch.png" caption="Pictorial representation of mutual information gain" id="img_mut_info">

use the build string that matches the python and cuda version, replacing
the pytorch version and build string appropriately:

``` sh
conda install pytorch=2.0.0=cuda118py310h072bc4c pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

Update cuda-toolkit:

``` sh
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
```

Verify cuda is available: Run `python` and
`import torch; torch.cuda.is_available()`

- Install using:

``` sh
pip install xcube
```

Configure accelerate by:

``` sh
accelerate config
```

## How to use

You can either clone the repo and open it in your own machine. Or if you
donâ€™t want to setup a python development environment, an even easier and
quicker approach is to open this repo using [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You can open this readme
page in Colab using this
[link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/debjyotiSRoy/xcube/blob/plant/nbs/index.ipynb).

``` python
IN_COLAB = is_colab()
```

    Not running in Google Colab

``` python
source_mimic3 = untar_xxx(XURLs.MIMIC3_DEMO)
source_mimic4 = untar_xxx(XURLs.MIMIC4)
path = Path.cwd().parent/f"{'xcube' if IN_COLAB else ''}" # root of the repo
(path/'tmp/models').mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)
tmp = path/'tmp'
```

Check your GPU memory! If you are running this on google colab be sure
to turn on the GPU runtime. You should be able to train and infer all
the models with atleast 16GB of memory. However, note that training the
full versions of the datasets from scratch requires atleast 48GB memory.

``` python
cudamem()
```

    GPU: Quadro RTX 8000
    You are using 0.0 GB
    Total GPU memory = 44.99969482421875 GB
