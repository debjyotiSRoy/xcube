    "We can perform tensorized computation if we think of `p_TL` as a 4 dim tensor of size `(len(toks), len(lbs), 2, 2)`. Next, to be able to estimate `p_TL` we just need to iterate over the dataset and for each data point and each token-label pair record the `p_TL` information in the last two dimension of the tensor `p_TL`. And, at the end divide by size of the dataset. \n",

    "- Unless you are doing this in 2035 you probably do not have enogh GPU-RAM to fit the entire `p_TL` tensor of dimension `(len(toks), len(lbs), 2, 2)`. So we are going to split the lbs dimension into chunks. (Why the `lbs` dimension and not the `toks`? Because in XML datsets `toks` are approximately 60000, but the number of `lbs` could be really large of the order of millions.) With reagrd to implementation this would mean that instead of one dataloader we would roll with multiple dataloaders. And each dataloader would load the dataset in a way that mini-batches would contain the full one-hot encoding of the `text` field but only a certain `chunk` of the one-hot encoded `labels` field in `df`. Another way to think about this is that each datapoint, specifically the `labels` are splitted across multiple dataloaders. This way once we are done iterating over one such dataloader we would have filled a ceratin chunk of the `joint` dataframe shown above. And we would fill the entire `joint` only once we are done iterating over all the dataloaders. "
