One major application of XMTC is in the global healthcare system, specifically in the context of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). ICD coding is the process of assigning codes representing diagnoses and procedures performed during a patient visit using clinical notes documented by health professionals.\n",

    "This repository is my attempt to create Extreme Multi-Label Text Classifiers using Language Model Fine-Tuning as proposed by [Jeremy Howard](https://jeremy.fast.ai) and [Sebastian Ruder](https://www.ruder.io) in [ULMFit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06146v5.pdf). I am also heavily influenced by the [fast.ai's](https://fast.ai) course [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) and the excellent library [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai). I have adopted the style of coding from [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) using the jupyter based dev environment [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/). Since this is one of my fast attempt to create a full fledged python library, I have at times replicated implementations from fastai with some modifications. A big thanks to Jeremy and his team from [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) for everything they have been doing to make AI accessible to everyone."
